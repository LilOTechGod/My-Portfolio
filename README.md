## My first CSS project
This is my challenge for unit two, it's a protoype of what my final profile will look like, more or less. The purpose of this project was to structure my web page using HTML elements then using CSS to style my page with flex box.

## Motivation
My first week into bootcamp we spoke about HTML, Git, and CSS. In order to achieve my goals, I used my determination to test my skills and applied these computer languages. I created a web page that represents a profile of my self in which holds everything I learned in week one.

## Build status
It's like the saying goes,"It's about the journey not the destination". That's exactly what this project was, a journey! I had a great start with only the knowledge I acquired within 4 days of bootcamp. I soon came to realize that I structured my HTML wrong resulting for me to add and subtract elements, change and delete most CSS rules. Altought I ran into set backs I was still able to create a webpage which is still under constructions so, a finished version is yet to come! Wait on it.
